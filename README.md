This repository contains resources for the [Applied Linear Algebra](https://en.via.dk/tmh-courses/applied-linear-algebra) course at VIA University College, Horsens, Denmark.

**Literature & Resources:**

Lay: Lay, David C. _Linear Algebra and its applications_, 4th edition. (e-book, up to students to retrieve a copy). All chapters and exercises referenced will be to the **4th edition**. Make sure you have the correct edition or else the exercise numbers will not match.

Note, for each lesson I have uploaded the presentations that accompany the book. I will in no way use these during classes and they are merely uploaded for your notes/convenience. The notes that I have uploaded are an electronic version of my personal lecture notes and contain most of the (relevant) material for the sections in questions.

Non-session specific resources such as the exercises from the book, solutions, old exam cases, etc. can be found her:

**Prerequisites:**

Contrary to SMP, you do not need to recap MSE topics. More so it would be important that you recap some of your high-school math. Most importantly:

<ul>
	<li>Linear equations</li>
	<li>Systems of linear equations</li>
	<li>Vectors and vector operations</li>
	<li>Differential equations</li>
</ul>

**Online Resources:**
<p>If you want to check out online courses about linear algebra there is really only one resource that you need to direct your attention to: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8">MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra</a>, Spring 2005 by&nbsp;the legendary Prof.&nbsp;Gilbert Strang. This is teaching at its very purest and finest.</p>

**Exercises and Previous Exams**

The provided solutions to the exercises from the book were provided by the publisher and were thus not made by me. The previous exam cases are divided into two parts: one before and one after Wiseflow. Your exam will be new in the sense that it will contain an element with Flowlock. The exercises will still be similar to the previous cases and they are thus representative of the ones you will encounter. The difference will be that the more Python-intensive exercises will be in the part with aids and the ones that can be done just as quick by hand will be in the Flowlock part.

If/When you find mistakes in the solutions, please notify me so I can update them.

**Wiseflow code for all flows that are used during the course is always 0000**. This is not the code for the actual exam in August, though.
